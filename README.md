### Emile Tal
*Full-stack software engineer*

### My mission
Driven by a love for problem-solving, I find coding to be the perfect way to tackle complex challenges and create solutions that positively impact others. My background in hospitality has equipped me with strong interpersonal skills, allowing me to easily communicate  with people, understand their unique needs, and craft solutions that address their concerns. This combination of technical ability and empathy enables me to approach each problem with both precision and insight.

### Current projects
I'm currently learning to create RESTful APIs with Python (Flask), containerizing with Docker, and deploying with Google Cloud Run. I'm also experimenting with PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases.
